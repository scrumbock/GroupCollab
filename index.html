     <p><br><span id="us">From the start, the Perthera sought to be a patient-centric organization and earn the respect of patients and their entire cancer care team (medical professionals and loved ones). By doing so, they wanted to help democratize cancer care so that high-quality care would be accessible to any cancer patient regardless of where their location, access to resources, or financial standing.<br>

<br>The co-founders knew if they were successful, they would create a new cancer care ecosystem, which is happening. Chip, who now serves as Brigade Chief Science Officer, brings a distinguished career as a medical researcher in such subjects as cutting-edge micro proteomic technologies, biomarkers for early stage disease detection, and the development of mathematical and bioinformatics approaches for molecular network elucidation and protein-protein interaction analysis. Dendy, now the Pertheraâ€™s Chairman and the Chairman of the Board, has a successful track record as the founder, Chairman, and CEO of several technology companies, including a public corporation which he grew into the largest value-added reseller serving the government market, with nearly $1 billion in annual revenue.<br>

<br>As the company evolved and realized the initial success of its marketing effort, as well as the success of the Know Your Tumor program through its partnership with the Pancreatic Cancer Action Network, the company began building its management team by appointing Andrew Mignatti as CEO. In the summer of 2016, the Company raised $8.7 million in financing with $1.2 million from individual investors and $7.5 million provided by Pilot Equity Growth. Perthera used the proceeds to continue developing its management and medical teams so it could assume a leadership position in the global precision medicine market.</span><br></p>
